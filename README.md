# Overview of Project: 
In this repository, you'll find a dynamic website built from a myriad of lines of UFO data. Since the all this data can be so overwhelming for a typical user, the purpose of this anlysis was to build a filterable table using data stored in a JavaScript array. The website was created with multiple filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

# Results: 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The website was customized using Bootstrap, and the table was equipped with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. Study the below image and we'll begin to learn more about the specific filters for this data project.
